# Advanced-Regression-Techniques

This repository includes two jupyter Notebooks that were created in the context of the EPFL Extension School.
The first one (warm-up) is a simple execution of basic Regression Techniques tasks.
The explicit individual Task is included in the notebook.  
The second notebook is an Analysis of Housing Prices in Ames Iowa.   
The Analysis includes:
- Filling missing Data
- Feature Encoding
- Feature Engineering
- Removing Outliers and Splitting the Data
- Creating multiple Models with varying Cost-Functions and Complexity
- Using Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation to select Features
- Comparing our created Models
- Making Predictions based on our best-performing Model

Should the person who is looking at this analysis have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact me.
